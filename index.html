                <p><q>Traditionally, when you first begin taking piano lessons&mdash;especially classical piano&mdash;you’re not really taught much about key signatures beyond remembering the one or two sharps or flats you have to play in the piece of sheet music set in front of you. You’re taught to play the notes exactly as they occur in that piece, without much thought about what relationship those notes have with one another in the key.</q></p>
                <p><q>Conversely, guitar players (even bass guitar players) are almost immediately taught about chords, scales, and finding their way around the guitar neck intuitively in their lessons. Note reading is saved for more advanced students who are already familiar with all the sounds of their instrument and where those sounds are located.<q></p>
                <p><q>This situation is why a lot of classically trained pianists have such a hard time learning how to improvise, and why guitarists and bassists who may not even know how to read music have an edge over such students when it comes to improvising. Knowing which notes go into a specific key is essential when you’re playing with other musicians, or even if you’re noodling around on your own without the help of sheet music.</q></p>

                    <h3>Wikipedia<sup>2</sup></h3>
                    <p><q>In music theory, the circle of fifths is a visual representation of the relationships among the 12 tones of the chromatic scale, their corresponding key signatures, and the associated major and minor keys. More specifically, it is a geometrical representation of relationships among the 12 pitch classes of the chromatic scale in pitch class space.</q></p>
                    <p><q>A simple way to hear the relationship between these notes is by playing them on a piano keyboard. If you traverse the circle of fifths backwards, the notes will feel as though they fall into each other. This aural relationship is what the mathematics describe.</q></p>

                    <p><q>The circular, clockwise arrangement of the twelve keys in an order of ascending fifths (C, D, d, a, etc.), showing that after twelve such steps the initial key is reached again. In this order, each successive key increases by one the number of sharps in the key signature. If the circle is viewed counter-clockwise (i.e., order of descending fifths: c, f, b♭, etc.), the keys follow each other with one or more flat in the signature. At one point of the circle the transition from the sharp keys to the flat keys must be made.</q></p>
